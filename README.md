# Q2 – quarantine

As of now, most of the world is in a special situation. As all I can do to support is #stayhome, I wanna make the best out of this.

I won't start a new round of #100DaysOfCode, because I clearly failed at the last gazillion attempts in doing round 4 😅. However.. I wanna set up new goals & work on them. One quarter are exactly 13 weeks.. so..

Here I will collect everything code-related. 😊

## Goals

### [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)

My goal is the get the course certificate.. cannot hurt, right? 🤓😇
Being self-taught & not having a CS degree is not often a problem, but having it may be a good thing. Also having the knowledge definitely will make me a better programmer altogether. 😊

After the course I will have submitted 9 problem sets & one final project. And hopefully get the certificate. 🤞😊 For now.. I will choose the web track – focusing on HTML, CSS & JS
